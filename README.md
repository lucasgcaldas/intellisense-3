### üìñ The Questions 

- [ ] What is an AGI?

  AGI is also called strong AI or deep AI and means Artificial General Intelligence that is the hypothetical ability of an intelligent agent to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It‚Äôs on par with human capabilities. Therefore, AGI systems can perform the task with greater efficacy than humans only for a particular/single function assigned to them, while they have zero capability to do any task which is not assigned to them.

- [ ] How NLP (Natural Language Processing) works and where can we use it?

  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a part of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that makes human language intelligible to machines. NLP studies the rules and structure of language, and create intelligent systems capable of understanding, analyzing, and extracting meaning from text and speech.

  NLP is used to understand the structure and meaning of human language by analyzing different aspects like syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and morphology. Therefore, this linguistic knowledge is become into rule-based, machine learning algorithms.

  One example is the Gmail. Emails are automatically categorized as Promotions, Social, Primary, or Spam, thanks to an NLP task called keyword extraction. By ‚Äúreading‚Äù words in subject lines and associating them with predetermined tags, machines automatically learn which category to assign emails.


- [ ] Can you name 3 practical ways AI could help people with disability? How?

  Yes, the AI helps increasing in communication, accessibility and independence. For example, the voice-assisted as Amazon Alexa, Google Home that can help individuals with visual impairments and the development of speech-to-text and text-to-speech technology provides even more interactive opportunities for individuals recovering from brain injuries, such as people who have cerebral palsy. To people with hearing impairments, AI offers closed captioning programs to boost understanding.
  
- [ ] About the negative impact of AI which concerns you the most? Why?

  For me, the worst impact of AI is the data theft. That is the act of stealing digital information stored on computers, servers, or any devices of an unknown victim with the intent to compromise privacy or obtain confidential information, for example financial information, like credit card numbers or bank accounts, to personal information, like social security numbers, drivers license numbers, and health records.
